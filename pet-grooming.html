    <h2>Pet Grooming</h2>
    <p>
    Pet grooming is something that we take seriously here at Noah’s Ark. Not only does it help your pet look his/her best,
	it is also vital for their health and well-being. When groomed regularly, diseases can be prevented and diagnosed early.
	That is why all our employees working in our pet salon are all highly qualified and experienced individuals.
