    <h2>Dog Training</h2>
    <p>
    Noah’s Ark knows how important it is to properly train a dog. Not only does it help to promote greater mental health in your
	dog, it also benefits them by giving them a desirable way to exercise, thus also increasing their physical health.
	Additionally, you, as the owner, can also gain quite a lot from having a trained dog. The bond between you and your dog will
	grow, your dog’s behavior will be excellent (thus making it easier to care for him/her), and you will be able to show all your
	friends all the neat tricks your furry best friend can do.

		  <td class="description">
		  When you first get a puppy, it’s perfectly reasonable if a few accidents happen here and there. However, this is a behavior
		  that needs to be corrected quickly before it involves into a habit. Our Potty-Training class is perfect for those who are
		  worried or struggling to teach their puppy where to properly go to the bathroom. Options available for 2-week, 4-week, and
		  8-week classes that meet once per week. We also work with older dogs on a case-by-case basis.

		  <td class="description">
		  When it comes to training a dog to correctly walk on a leash, owners sometimes find themselves frustrated because their pet
		  just doesn’t seem to want to listen. Whether they are walking too fast or too slow, the experience can quickly become a bad
		  one for both human and dog. With the Leash Training class offered at Noah’s Ark though, all of this can go away quickly.
		  Within a few classes, you will notice a significant difference in your dog’s conduct – no longer will he/she pull on the least
		  until they choke themselves! Options available for 2-week, 4-week, and 8-week classes that meet once per week. This class works
		  with dogs of all ages.

		  tricks. Options available for 8-week and 12-week classes that meet once per week. This class is offered for dogs that are six months
